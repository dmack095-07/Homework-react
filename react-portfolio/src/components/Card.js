          <p>A Texas implant who came to North Carolina in 2019. I am orginally from Norfolk, Virgina. We are a military family. Being in the military gave our family the opportunity to travel around the United States. We lived in Maine, Nevada, and Tennessee to name a few places. I believe we will end up back in Texas, one day.
          </p>
          <p>Throughout this journey, my love for technology grew over the years. My path to becoming a Full-Stack developer became a reality once Covid-19 began. This pandemic pushed me further into the world of technology.</p>
          <p>When I am not coding, I enjoy being outdoors playing basketball, tennis and walking.</p>
